# blog-to-lazyppl
Translator from Stuart Russel et al.'s BLOG language to Sam Staton et al.'s LazyPPL Haskell library.
- BLOG can be found here: https://bayesianlogic.github.io/
- LazyPPL can be found here: https://lazyppl-team.github.io/
- The lexer is generated by Alex: https://haskell-alex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- The parser is generated by Happy: https://haskell-happy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The translator is composed of three functions:
- `lexer :: String -> [Token]`
- `parser :: [Token] -> Program`
- `translator :: Program -> String`

For example a typical GHCi command would be `(translator.parser.lexer) "random Real a ~ Gaussian(0, 10); query a"`

The BLOGLex, BLOGParse and BLOGTranslate modules all expose a main method which expects the file path of a BLOG source file as input.

Note that several grammatical features of BLOG are currently untranslated:
- IF-THEN statements (as opposed to IF-THEN-ELSE statements)
- matrices, vectors, and distributions which support them
- time steps, and language features which support them
- constants (EG pi)
- some inbuilt functions

this may not be an exhaustive list. Where possible, the translator reports when a program contains a language feature which isn't translated yet.
